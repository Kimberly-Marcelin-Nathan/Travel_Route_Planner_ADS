# Travel_Route_Planner_ADS | Kimberly-Marcelin-Nathan

The "Travel Route Planner" project presents a comprehensive solution for optimizing travel itineraries based on budget constraints and geographical distances. 
Leveraging advanced algorithms such as the Knapsack problem using the Greedy Method and dynamic programming for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), 
the application aims to provide users with efficient and optimal travel routes. By integrating these algorithms, the project offers a streamlined user experience, 
allowing users to input their preferences and constraints easily. The application provides accurate representations of locations and routes through geocoding and mapping functionalities. 
Overall, the "Travel Route Planner" facilitates cost-effective travel planning tailored to individual needs, ensuring a satisfying and memorable travel experience
